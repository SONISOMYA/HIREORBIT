#  HireOrbit — Internship & Job Application Tracker

HireOrbit is your personal assistant for managing all your internship and job applications in one organized place.  
It’s built with **Spring Boot**, **JWT authentication**, **Flutter UI**, and a clean backend–frontend separation.

## Why I Built This

A few months ago, I actually forgot to apply for **three** companies during my on-campus placement drive — simply because I lost track of deadlines and didn’t have a clear overview.  
That small mistake cost me real opportunities, and it made me realize how easy it is to get overwhelmed when you’re juggling multiple applications, interviews, and follow-ups.

So, I built **HireOrbit** for myself — to **never miss a deadline again**, to **track every application**, and to feel more **in control** of my job hunt.  
Along the way, I learned to build secure REST APIs with **Spring Boot**, implement **JWT authentication**, and design a modern, glassmorphic Flutter interface.

If HireOrbit helps even one student avoid missing out on their dream role, it’s worth it.
