##  Why I Built This

A few months ago, I actually forgot to apply for **three** companies during my on-campus placement drive — simply because I lost track of deadlines and didn’t have a clear overview.  
That small mistake cost me real opportunities, and it made me realize how easy it is to get overwhelmed when you’re juggling multiple applications, interviews, and follow-ups.

So, I built **HireOrbit** for myself — to **never miss a deadline again**, to **track every application**, and to feel more **in control** of my job hunt.  
Along the way, I learned to build secure REST APIs with **Spring Boot**, implement **JWT authentication**, and design a modern, glassmorphic Flutter interface.

If HireOrbit helps even one student avoid missing out on their dream role, it’s worth it.

##  New Feature: Smart Email Notifications (Added on August 6, 2025)

We've added a **fully-automated email reminder system** so you never miss deadlines again!

### What’s New:

- **Daily Reminder Emails**:  
  Sent **every morning** for jobs that have an upcoming deadline.  
  > _“The deadline for the job at Amazon for the profile of SDE is on 08 August 2025.”_

- **Final Day Alerts**:  
  If it’s the last day, you’ll receive emails **every 6 hours** until the deadline.

- **No Deadline? No Problem**:  
  If a job doesn't have a deadline, you'll still get a **confirmation email** when you add it — but no repeated reminders.

- **Status Change Notifications**:  
  Every time you update the status of a job (e.g. from "Applied" to "Interviewing"), HireOrbit automatically sends you an update email:
  > _“The status for your application at Google for SDE has been updated to ‘Interviewing’.”_

### How It Works

- Uses Spring Boot’s `@Scheduled` tasks to check for deadlines every day/hour.
- All emails are sent via `JavaMailSender`.
- You just need to **add your email once** after login to start receiving updates!
